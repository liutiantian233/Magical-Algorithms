About The Algorithms

## Written at the beginning

Algorithms are one of the most critical components of a computer's operation. It can even be of the opinion that there is no algorithm to run the computer. But for most of the algorithms introduced, it is not easy to understand. I am also facing this kind of difficulty now, so I am wondering if there is a well-organized record-clear algorithm learning process.

This is a transparent process for me to learn algorithms, and for me it might be just a note or a simple record. But for you to read this manuscript, will be a good report if you are learning algorithms or are interested. And I will just try to be complete as far as possible, I think this note takes a short time. Because I am in the process of learning, thank you for understanding.

I distinguish different algorithms according to the type of algorithm and arrange them in order. I suggest you amend to read in order. Each algorithm will have specific examples and backgrounds. Although I am familiar with Python and C++, I still decided to use C as an example language. The C language is the best language in the process.
